# 🏡 House Price Prediction (India)

This project predicts house prices using a real-world dataset from Kaggle.  
It's a beginner-friendly machine learning regression project built with Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given features like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, and house grade,  
can we predict the selling price of a house?

## 📦 What I Did

-  Loaded & explored the dataset
-  Cleaned and prepared the data
-  Trained a Linear Regression model
-  Evaluated model with RMSE (₹2.5 Lakhs)
-  Visualized predictions vs actuals
